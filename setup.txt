Setup involves setting up LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, Python) platform and Test setup.

Linux installation and setup:
- Fedora 15 is installed on the machine
- /home/me is the home directory
- Add devi.com entry to /etc/hosts file (Both ipv4, ipv6 lines), to access the local host as devi.com

Apache Installation and setup:
- httpd is the name of apache server. This is installed with Linux installation
- Fedora comes with SELinux security permission. All files will have dot(‘.’) at the end of their file permission. 
  This creates problem resulting in directory or index forbidden error.
  Set SELinux=DISABLED by editing /etc/selinux/config file and then rebooting the system. This will make sure all the
  new files created will not have dot at the end file permission.
- Remove dot for existing files using Setfattr –x Security.Selinux <file> or file/*. This will apply to /home, /home/me,
  /home/me/RESTservices, /home/me/RESTservices/*, /var, /var/www, /var/www/cgibin, /var/www/html, /etc, /etc/*
- All files accessed (in directory hierarchy) by Apache should have Read and Execute permission for Owner, Group and 
  Other users.
- Check and set Read and Execute file permission (if not already set). This will apply to /home,/home/me, 
  /home/me/RESTservices,/home/me/RESTservices/*. /var, /var/www,/var/www/cgibin
- Edit /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf is the config file. Make a copy of this file and add ExecCGI,FollowSymlinks.
- Setup logical link to access REST service from browser (service.py). 
- Under /var/www/cgibin,create a link to service directory. ln –s /home/me/RESTservices REST.
- service httpd start will start the Apache web server.
- service httpd status will show the httpd processes running
- Test your server devi.com by running a sample URI request devi.com/cgibin/REST/sample.html 
- service httpd stop will stop the Apache Web server
- /etc/log/httpd/error_log (tail to look at recent entries) can be checked for httpd errors that occur. 
- /etc/log/httpd/Access_log can be checked for access errors by httpd

MySQL setup:
- mysql and server related files are installed using system tools (add or remove programs)
- rpm –q mysql shows up mysql installation
- Download mysql.sampledatabase
- Mysqldb module to be installed. yum install pythonlevel; yum install mysqldevel
- /etc/rc.d/init/d/mysqld start will start the mysql daemon process
- /etc/rc.d/init/d/mysqld stop will stop mysql daemon
- mysql –u root to connect to mysql ; show databases ; use test will open test database
- /usr/bin/mysqladmin –u root shutdown to shutdown mysql processes
- Test the setup by connecting to mysql (mysql –u root)

Python setup:
- /usr/bin/python and /usr/lib is where python is installed. Project uses python 2.7.
- Python files(.py) should have #!/usr/bin/python as the first line in the file
- Install python interface for mysql (yum install mysqlpython)

Test setup:
- Create user (xyz). Grant all privileges
- Create test database.
- Create tables categories and products
- Insert rows into tables
- devi.com/cgibin/REST/service.py will run the service

Before running any service run the shell script
